To add a list item, simply click the green plus icon in the bottom right of the screen.

Once you have added a few tasks, you should see the screen start to fill up while leaving room for the fish to swim around.

If you check a task, a piece of food will be dropped into the tank. Your fishy friend will then swim to the food and eat it.
